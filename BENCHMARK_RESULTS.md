## Summary: Backend + Flash Attention 2 Comparison

| Backend | RTF (Avg) | Latency (Avg) | vs Official | Flash Attn Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Official** | 0.97 | 8.49s | Baseline | - |
| **Official + Flash Attn 2** ⚡ | **0.87** | **7.28s** | **+10% faster** | ✅ +10% |
| **vLLM-Omni** | 0.83 | 7.85s | +14% faster | - |
| **vLLM-Omni + Flash Attn 2** | 0.90 | 8.14s | +7% faster | ⚠️ -8% |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Flash Attention 2 significantly improves Official backend** (+10% RTF improvement)
- ⚠️ **Flash Attention 2 slightly degrades vLLM-Omni** (-8% RTF regression, likely due to optimization conflicts)
- 🏆 **Winner: Official + Flash Attn 2** - Best balance of speed (RTF 0.87) and consistency

**RTF = Real-Time Factor** (lower is better: <1.0 means faster than real-time)

## Detailed Benchmark Results

### Official Backend (PyTorch)

| Test Case | Words | Cold | Warm Median | RTF | p95 |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Short | 2 | 2.20s | 1.01s | 1.02 | 1.70s |
| Sentence | 7 | 3.65s | 3.29s | 1.00 | 3.69s |
| Medium | 20 | 9.70s | 8.50s | 0.94 | 9.12s |
| Long | 36 | 19.68s | 21.16s | 0.92 | 22.39s |

**Average RTF: 0.97** (approximately real-time)

### vLLM-Omni Backend

| Test Case | Words | Cold | Warm Median | RTF | p95 |
|-----------|-------|------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Short | 2 | 0.82s | 1.79s | 0.91 | 2.31s |
| Sentence | 7 | 3.35s | 3.61s | 0.85 | 8.19s |
| Medium | 20 | 7.72s | 6.81s | 0.79 | 7.24s |
| Long | 36 | 20.28s | 19.21s | 0.78 | 32.78s |

**Average RTF: 0.83** (~20% faster than real-time)

## Test Prompts

1. **2 words**: "Hello world"
2. **Sentence**: "Kia ora koutou, welcome to today's meeting."
3. **Medium**: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog near the riverbank. This is a test of text-to-speech generation quality."
4. **Long**: "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Text-to-speech technology has advanced significantly in recent years. Modern neural networks can generate remarkably natural-sounding speech. The Qwen3-TTS model represents the latest breakthrough in this field."

## Key Findings

### Performance

- **vLLM-Omni is 14-20% faster** for RTF on medium/long text
- **Official backend has more consistent latency** (lower p95 variance)
- **vLLM-Omni cold start is ~10x slower** due to stage initialization
- Both backends use ~3.89 GB VRAM for the 1.7B model

### Recommendations

| Use Case | Recommended Backend |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Production API (high throughput)** | vLLM-Omni |
| **Development/Testing** | Official |
| **Low latency short text** | Official |
| **Batch processing** | vLLM-Omni |
| **Memory constrained** | Either (same VRAM) |

### Scalability

**Official Backend:**
- ✅ Fast model loading (~11s)
- ✅ Consistent latency
- ✅ Simple deployment
- ⚠️ RTF ~1.0 (barely real-time for long text)

**vLLM-Omni Backend:**
- ✅ 20% faster generation
- ✅ Better for batch/concurrent requests
- ⚠️ Slow cold start (~100s)
- ⚠️ Higher p95 variance
- **Overall**: Excellent audio quality maintained across all test cases

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment

1. **Interactive Applications**: Use GPU mode (RTX 3090 or equivalent)
   - Real-time voice synthesis
   - Chat applications
   - Voice assistants
   - Live demonstrations

2. **Batch Processing**: CPU mode acceptable if:
   - No real-time requirements
   - Processing can happen offline
   - Input length < 20 words
   - Cost optimization is priority

3. **Optimal Configuration**:
   - Docker with GPU support (CUDA 12.1+)
   - Pre-load model at startup (handled automatically)
   - Consider queue system for high concurrency

### Hardware Requirements

**Minimum GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM
**Recommended GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3090 or better (24GB VRAM)
**CPU Alternative**: Multi-core CPU with 16GB+ RAM (batch processing only)
